### Description

This code is a custom control I wrote for use in our companies products. It has tons of implemented ideas in it - way, way too much to list. So a full HTML help file is also included.

The grid will bind directly to an ADO recordset, or will make an internal copy of the recordset if you wish.

I would like to thank everybody that posts on this site. Some of the examples have been invaluable over the years, so I like to return the favors.

Please vote again, I submitted it on the last day of february originally, so it had no chance.
